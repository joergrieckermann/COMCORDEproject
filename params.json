{"name":"COMCORDE","tagline":"Using Commercial Microwave links and Computer Model Emulation to Reduce Uncertainties in Urban Drainage Simulations","body":"# Welcome to the COMCORDE project.\r\n\r\n## Why we're here\r\n\r\nThe COMCORDE project investigates _how better information on urban rainfall_ and _better modeling capabilities_ can help _improve flood protection for our cities and reduce environmental pollution from sewer overflows_. \r\n\r\nThe **goals** of our project, which is organized around three PhD theses, are to \r\n* reduce the uncertainty in predicted wet weather flows with rainfall information from alternative sensors, such as microwave links from telecommunication networks (Work package A), \r\n* more reliable techniques for uncertainty analysis of urban drainage models (B) and to \r\n* decrease the computational requirements of sewer flow prediction models by emulation (C). \r\n\r\nOur **results** suggest, that \r\n\r\n1. microwave links from telecommunication networks improve urban rainfall monitoring, especially if their rainfall observations are assimilated with rain gauges and weather radars. Using a simple model for short-time rainfall forecasts, lead times of 10-30 minutes were obtained. \r\n2. regarding the uncertainty analysis of urban drainage models our explicit consideration of systematic model deficiencies delivers more realistic prediction uncertainties than traditional methods. It also compares favorably with similar methods for advanced uncertainty analysis, which have been suggested recently. \r\n3. we could demonstrate that our mechanistic emulator is 100-200 times faster than the represented urban drainage simulators. It is also generally superior to non-mechanistic emulators, even with a very simple linear model.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Authors and Contributors\r\nThe project coordinator is Jörg Rieckermann from Eawag, CH (@joergrieckermann).
